### BlockChain Concepts: Behind-the-Scenes
#### What's BlockChain?
> **Blockchain** is nothing more than a simple list of records or as buzzwords explain, the ***blocks*** which are linked through cryptographic techniques.
* 3 ingredients that makes a blockchain:

        1. Cryptographic Hash of the previous block
        2. The timestamp
        3. The transaction data (or any other info to be decentralised)

- The concept of decentralisation makes blockchain *immutable*, so no single block can be changed/altered without making changes to all subsequent blocks.
- Conclusively, Understand the concept of **Blockchain as a protocol for inter-node communication & validating new blocks.**

### How did the magic happen
